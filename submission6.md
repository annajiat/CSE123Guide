[!badge variant="secondary" text="Group Work"]

Identical to Submission 4 & 5, but you must finish your full research paper within then and you have to submit your research paper to a conference in order to publish it.

Create a Google Slide covering the whole research paper concept. **All the slides must have page numbers.** Present the slides by screen recording it. Then, upload the presentation video in YouTube making it **unlisted** in privacy settings. Then add the video in the Unlisted YouTube playlist we made earlier.

Contact your assigned RA to suggest a suitable conference for you from [Paper Submission Venues](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16plzjeJNMZjK5S_zDLOKqqk8WOcJiWpeUrLfF6swfGU/edit?usp=sharing). **You must take feedback and approval from your ST & RA and incorporate the changes if necessary before you can submit in the conference.**

**Most of the conference asks to hide the author section for Blind Checking Policy so make sure to do that.** Just comment out the author section with `ctrl`+`/`.

After you submit it in the conference you would be given a mail and a Paper submission ID. Print the mail as PDF or take a screenshot of it and upload that in GitHub after you create a folder named `submission6` in your repository.

In the folder named `submission6` in your repository, make a text file named `README.txt`. The format of the repository and the `README.txt` will be like the given [sample](https://github.com/errhythm/CSE123/tree/main/submission6). Copy and paste the sample text in the GitHub then fill it up and copy the link of your folder.

Now update your Course Spreadsheet Task 6 cell with the given sample. After that submit it in **Google Form** as well.
