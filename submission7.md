Complete another research paper with project and submit it in a conference as well. You must take feedback from your ST & RA and incorporate the changes if necessary before you can submit in the conference.

Now present the research paper by screen recording it. You can either make a Google Slide or present the paper from overleaf directly, any of them works. Then, upload the presentation video in YouTube making it **unlisted** in privacy settings. Then add the video in the Unlisted YouTube playlist we made earlier.

After you submit it in the conference you would be given a mail and a Paper submission ID. Print the mail as PDF or take a screenshot of it and upload that in GitHub after you create a folder named `submission7` in your repository. Upload the Final PDF in the same folder.

Make a text file named `README.txt` in the folder. The format of the repository and the `README.txt` will be like the given [sample](https://github.com/errhythm/CSE123/tree/main/submission6). Copy and paste the sample text in the GitHub then fill it up and copy the link of your folder.
