Identical to Submission 4, but you must finish your 2nd draft. You should complete 75% of your research paper within then in the Overleaf Project.

Now present the second draft of your research paper by screen recording it. You can either make a Google Slide or present the paper from overleaf directly, any of them works. Then, upload the presentation video in YouTube making it **unlisted** in privacy settings. Then add the video in the Unlisted YouTube playlist we made earlier.

Create a folder named `submission5` in your repository and make a text file named `README.txt`. The format of the repository and the `README.txt` will be like the given [sample](https://github.com/errhythm/CSE123/tree/main/submission5). Copy and paste the sample text in the GitHub then fill it up and copy the link of your folder.

Now update your Course Spreadsheet Task 5 cell with the given sample. After that submit it in Google Form as well.
