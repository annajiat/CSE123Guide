The first step of starting this course should be finding or forming a team. Recommended Research Team size is 1 to 4 students each, combined with 1 ST and 1 RA. You can make smaller teams or it can be only 1 student combined with 1 ST & 1 RA as well if you are unwilling/unable to find team members. You will find your course individual and team worksheet in your respective slack channel.

In the worksheet you will find multiple teams and fields with name and ID. On the rightmost fields you will find the name of ST and RA assigned to different teams. You guys can select them yourself, just check the names in the rightmost cells. It would be like the following:

The assigned ST & RA will help you guide the project, provide feedback, help you in this course and help you in the publication process even after this course. Approach any of them using Slack/discord and join their consultation if necessary.

Along with your assigned ST & RA, you can consult any ST & RA from the course if you need additional help. You can select any team number you want to and after you have filled up your information in the team rows, join that team text channel in Slack. Click on All Channels on Slack or Search your team number, like if you are team 3, you can search #team-03. Join that channel. Make sure you are not joined in any otherâ€™s team channel. You must join the team channel according to your team number in Course Spreadsheet. If you want to work with any specific ST or RA, just get a team he is assigned in, you can change it anytime you want to.
